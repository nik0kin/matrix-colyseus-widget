Finding the best good open source sudoku

  - https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/Sudoku - super red
  - https://github.com/wburklund/sudoku-web - UX for marking/note state isnt great
  - https://github.com/pocketjoso/sudokuJS - demo is nice, but source isnt in repo
  - https://github.com/baruchel/sudoku-js - has hypothesis functionality - ux might not be obvious, great overall look
    - lacks persistance through refreshes & notes
