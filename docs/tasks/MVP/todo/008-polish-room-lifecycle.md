if two players join a game but never play it, what happens to the game?
  - how does the player know what happens

lock in players once the game starts and dont allow other new clients to play

remove a player if they dont reconnect after 500s if the game hasnt started

remove sessionStorage joinedGames that are no longer joined (eg 500s timeout)

if a player dc's and times out, neither player can rejoin the game.
