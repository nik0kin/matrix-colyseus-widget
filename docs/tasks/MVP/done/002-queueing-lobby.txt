    - is it possible to reconnect to a lobby room?
    - is LobbyRoom extendedable? then we could override the appropriate hook?
      - seems like both above solutions might not be needed. we can save the roomId/sessionId to sessionStorage
   X- working with a hack :(
 X- support multiple games
  X- query backend for what games are supported
   X- add dropdown to frontend
 X- lobby doesnt open specific game when "play" is clicked
 X- support CustomSettings for games
